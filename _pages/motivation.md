## Why Policy Clustering Matters

In offline RL, data often comes from mixed sources:

- Suboptimal aggregation → unstable updates
- Opaque behavior → hard to interpret or supervise

Clustering by underlying policies allows:

- Grouping similar behaviors → better learning
- Discovering latent modes (expert, explorer, etc.)
- More interpretable and robust learning dynamics
