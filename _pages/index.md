# Policy-Based Trajectory Clustering

**NeurIPS 2025 Submission by Xinqi Wang et al.**

We propose a novel task in offline reinforcement learning: clustering trajectories by the policies that generated them.

- **PG-Kmeans:** EM-style clustering with policy networks.
- **CAAE:** VQ-VAE-inspired latent space clustering.
